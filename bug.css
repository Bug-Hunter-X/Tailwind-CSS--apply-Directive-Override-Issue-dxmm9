This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom CSS classes that contain properties that are also defined in Tailwind's default configuration.  The `@apply` directive will override the custom styles in favor of Tailwind's defaults, even if the custom styles are more specific. For example:

```css
/* custom.css */
.my-custom-class {
  background-color: #ff0000;
}

/* main.css */
.my-component {
  @apply my-custom-class;
  @apply bg-blue-500; /* Tailwind's bg-blue-500 overrides custom bg-color */
}
```
In this case, `bg-blue-500` will override the `background-color: #ff0000` from `my-custom-class`, despite `my-custom-class` being applied first. This can lead to unexpected styling issues.
